### 1. Classification Metrics

**Accuracy**
- **Definition**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{True Positives + True Negatives}}{\text{Total Instances}} \)$
- **Example**: If your model correctly predicts 90 out of 100 instances, the accuracy is 90%.

**Precision**
- **Definition**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Positives}} \)$
- **Example**: If your model predicts 70 positives out of which 50 are correct, the precision is $\( \frac{50}{70} \)$.

**Recall (Sensitivity)**
- **Definition**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Negatives}} \)$
- **Example**: If there are 60 actual positives and your model correctly predicts 50 of them, the recall is $\( \frac{50}{60} \)$.

**F1 Score**
- **Definition**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision + Recall}} \)$
- **Example**: If the precision is 0.8 and recall is 0.6, the F1 Score is $\( 2 \times \frac{0.8 \times 0.6}{0.8 + 0.6} = 0.685 \)$.

**ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)**
- **Definition**: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate.
- **Example**: An AUC of 0.9 indicates a high ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

**Confusion Matrix**
- **Definition**: A table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing actual versus predicted values.
- **Example**:
  ```
  |            | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
  |------------|--------------------|--------------------|
  | Actual Positive  | 50                 | 10                 |
  | Actual Negative  | 5                  | 35                 |
  ```

### 2. Regression Metrics

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Definition**: The average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y_i}| \)$
- **Example**: If your model's predictions are off by an average of $3, the MAE is $3.

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Definition**: The average of the squared errors between predicted and actual values.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 \)$
- **Example**: If your model's predictions have an average squared error of 9, the MSE is 9.

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Definition**: The square root of the mean squared error.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2} \)$
- **Example**: If the MSE is 9, the RMSE is $\( \sqrt{9} = 3 \)$.

**R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**
- **Definition**: Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
- **Formula**: $\( R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}} \)$
- **Example**: An R-squared value of 0.8 indicates that 80% of the variance in the dependent variable is predictable from the independent variables.

### 3. Advanced Metrics

**Precision-Recall Curve**
- **Definition**: A plot that shows the trade-off between precision and recall for different threshold values.
- **Example**: Useful in situations where there is a class imbalance.

**Logarithmic Loss (Log Loss)**
- **Definition**: Measures the performance of a classification model where the output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{Log Loss} = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i \log(\hat{y_i}) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y_i})] \)$
- **Example**: Lower log loss values indicate better model performance.

**Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
- **Definition**: Measures the accuracy of a forecasting method by calculating the percentage error.
- **Formula**: $\( \text{MAPE} = \frac{100}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y_i}}{y_i} \right| \)$
- **Example**: If the MAPE is 10%, the average prediction error is 10% of the actual values.

### 4. Examples and Practical Applications

**Classification Example**:
- Suppose you build a spam email classifier. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score to evaluate its performance. For instance, if your model has high precision but low recall, it means it's good at identifying spam emails but misses a lot of actual spam emails.

**Regression Example**:
- If you're predicting house prices, you might use MAE, MSE, and RMSE to evaluate your model. A low RMSE indicates that your model's predictions are close to the actual values.
