A comprehensive guide on ML and AI models.

#### What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where machines learn from data to improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. 

#### Types of Machine Learning
Machine Learning is generally divided into three main types:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Training a model on labeled data (e.g., classification and regression tasks).
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in data without labeled responses (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding them for good decisions.
