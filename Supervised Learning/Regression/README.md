### Regression in Supervised Learning: A Comprehensive Guide

Regression is a fundamental concept in supervised learning, focusing on predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. Let's delve into the details step by step, starting from the basics and moving to advanced topics.

### Part 1: Basics of Regression

#### What is Regression?
Regression is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous value. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and other features.

#### Key Concepts
1. **Dependent Variable**: The variable we are trying to predict (e.g., house price).
2. **Independent Variables**: The variables used to make predictions (e.g., size, location).
3. **Linear Relationship**: A relationship that can be represented with a straight line.

### Part 2: Types of Regression

There are several types of regression, each suited for different kinds of problems.

#### 1. Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is used to predict a dependent variable using a single independent variable.

**Equation**:
$$\ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \$$

- $\( y \)$: Dependent variable
- $\( x \)$: Independent variable
- $\( \beta_0 \)$: Intercept
- $\( \beta_1 \)$: Slope

**Example**: Predicting house prices based on size.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:
1. **Data Preparation**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

    # Example data
    data = {'size': [650, 785, 1200, 1500, 2000],
            'price': [100, 150, 200, 250, 300]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    ```

2. **Splitting Data**:
    ```python
    X = df[['size']]
    y = df['price']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    ```

3. **Training the Model**:
    ```python
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

4. **Making Predictions**:
    ```python
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

5. **Evaluating the Model**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
    ```

6. **Plotting Results**:
    ```python
    plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue')
    plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='red')
    plt.xlabel('Size')
    plt.ylabel('Price')
    plt.title('Linear Regression')
    plt.show()
    ```

#### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict a dependent variable.

**Equation**:
$$\ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n \$$

- $\( y \)$: Dependent variable
- $\( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \)$: Independent variables
- $\( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n \)$: Coefficients

**Example**: Predicting house prices based on size and location.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:
1. **Data Preparation**:
    ```python
    # Adding a new feature 'location_score'
    data = {'size': [650, 785, 1200, 1500, 2000],
            'location_score': [3, 4, 2, 5, 4],
            'price': [100, 150, 200, 250, 300]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    ```

2. **Splitting Data**:
    ```python
    X = df[['size', 'location_score']]
    y = df['price']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    ```

3. **Training the Model**:
    ```python
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

4. **Making Predictions**:
    ```python
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

5. **Evaluating the Model**:
    ```python
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
    ```

### Part 3: Core Concepts in Regression

#### 1. Assumptions of Linear Regression
For linear regression to give reliable results, certain assumptions need to be met:
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear.
2. **Independence**: The residuals (errors) should be independent.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals should have constant variance.
4. **Normality**: The residuals should be normally distributed.

#### 2. Coefficients and Intercept
- **Intercept $\(\beta_0\)$**: The value of $\( y \)$ when all $\( x \)$ values are zero.
- **Slope $\(\beta_1, \beta_2, ...\)$**: The change in $\( y \)$ for a one-unit change in $\( x \)$.

#### 3. R-squared $\(R^2\)$
R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables.

**Equation**:
$$\ R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2} \$$

- $\( y_i \)$: Actual value
- $\( \hat{y}_i \)$: Predicted value
- $\( \bar{y} \)$: Mean of actual values

#### 4. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
MSE measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.

**Equation**:
$$\ MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \$$

### Part 4: Advanced Regression Techniques

#### 1. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression fits a polynomial equation to the data.

**Equation**:
$$\ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + ... + \beta_n x^n \$$

**Example**: Predicting house prices with a quadratic relationship.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:
1. **Data Preparation**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

    poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
    X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
    ```

2. **Splitting Data**:
    ```python
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_poly, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    ```

3. **Training the Model**:
    ```python
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

4. **Making Predictions**:
    ```python
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

5. **Evaluating the Model**:
    ```python
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
    ```

#### 2. Ridge and Lasso Regression (Regularization)
Regularization techniques add a penalty to the model's complexity to prevent overfitting.

**Ridge Regression** adds an L2 penalty:
$$\ \text{Cost} = \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum \beta_j^2 \$$

**Lasso Regression** adds an L1 penalty:
$$\ \text{Cost} = \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum |\beta_j| \$$

**Example: Ridge Regression**

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:
1. **Training the Model**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

    model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

2. **Making Predictions and Evaluating**:
    ```python
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Squared Error with Ridge Regression: {mse}')
    ```

#### 3. Decision Tree Regression
A decision tree splits the data into different branches to make predictions.

**Example**: Predicting house prices with a decision tree.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:
1. **Training the Model**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

    model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

2. **Making Predictions and Evaluating**:
    ```python
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Squared Error with Decision Tree: {mse}')
    ```

#### 4. Random Forest Regression
Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and

 merges their predictions.

**Example**: Predicting house prices with a random forest.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:
1. **Training the Model**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

2. **Making Predictions and Evaluating**:
    ```python
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Mean Squared Error with Random Forest: {mse}')
    ```
